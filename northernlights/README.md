###SMUNC Website

Hello!

This website was created using the following libraries:

- Bootstrap 3.3.6
- FontAwesome 4.6.3
- JQuery 1.11.1

However, we have used personalized versions that eliminated most components we did not need. As such, it is likely that by actively updating this site with new UI elements, you may need to redownload the libraries mentioned above, excluding JQuery, which was not stripped down.

We also used SASS as a CSS preprocessor for this website. Edits are made to the .sass file, which is then compiled (you will have to download your own compiler) into a pure CSS file. We highly recommend going this route and avoid editing pure CSS.


Feel free to contact the original owners if you have any questions.
